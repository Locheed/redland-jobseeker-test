# <a name="about"></a>About this project
This is a coding challenge project made for a [Redland](http://www.redland.fi) as a job applicant.

* ***What this project showed to me?***
  * Project showed me how good CMS Wordpress really is. Easy to learn and with a lot of support and documentation on web.
  * It really inspired me to learn Wordpress. Also I read a lot of documentation on many things that Wordpress is really capable.
  * I also really liked the idea about new version of Wordpress (Gutenberg) having a React in it. React is something that I really love so it was also a challenge to add React app running inside a PHP template in this older version of Wordpress.

* ***What next?***
  * Wordpress is a platform that I really liked learning. It's not going to be end with this project. I'm going to learn it more as fast as I can with my spare time and maybe learn it while working in Redland. :)
  * I'm going to keep learning more about basic Wordpress, plugin developing and specially React implementations. WP Rest API looks awesome to create React frontend with a Wordpress running as backend. :)
# <a name="features"></a>Features
  * Custom made Redland admin-panel. This panel allows changing frontpages hero texts. Also it has a small preview in a side.
  * Used a ACF-plugin to create custom fields of Team Members. (Custom post type)
  * Office locations (Addresses) created with a custom post type. (Normal post. No custom fields)
  * References page created with a React frontend. React renders it app inside a PHP template file. Data is fetched from WP database with WP Rest API (custom route /wp-json/sections/v1/references/ ).
